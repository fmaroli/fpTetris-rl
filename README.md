This repository contains two agents. The first `agent-algorithm`, has a pre-programmed behaviour. The second `agent-rl`, uses DQN Reinforcement Learning to learn how to play.

To execute the first agent, run the file `tetris.py`. Space Bar to drop the tetromino, R to restart, Q to Quit, Y to change to manual play(A,S Move)(K,L Rotate).

To execute the second agent, run the file `test.py`, this will load an agent from the folder models. I have pre-selected the best-performing agent, which cleared more than 100k lines.
